The automated moving/>
platforms move in eight/>
selectable patterns.\>
They all move at about/>
the same speed, so if you/>
want two platforms to/>
only sometimes line up,\>
you should use platforms/>
that travel two different/>
distances.\>
However, the vertical and/>
horizontal ones do have/>
slightly different/>
movement periods, and\>
will fall out of sync/>
over time.\>
They will move through any/>
surface and you'll get/>
knocked off if you hit a/>
wall.\>
Try to keep a max of six/>
on screen at any time or/>
the game will start to/>
lag.\>
The controllable hover/>
thingy does not work well/>
with them.\>
Unlike the Tower tileset,/>
Ruins phantom floors are/>
not disguised like normal/>
floors.

# 5: four horizontal tiles starting at the left

#
# unfortunately it looks like they're bounds checking this, so there aren't any wacky out of range ones, and any numbers above this behave the same as 4.
# note they all move at the same rate, so the ones that move the same distance will stay in sync, while different ones will fall out of sync.
# welllll except that the vertical and horizontal ones seem to be like one frame off, and fall off sync over time
