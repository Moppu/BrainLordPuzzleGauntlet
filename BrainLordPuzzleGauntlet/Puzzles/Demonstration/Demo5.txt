You can spawn in ice/>
to use for switch puzzles/>
like that one room in the/>
vanilla Ice Castle.\>
The ice acts the same as/>
a ball and slides until/>
it hits a wall.\>
It can be destroyed by the/>
fire sword which can add/>
complexity to puzzles.\>
It shows up and looks okay/>
on any tileset, but really/>
belongs on this one.\>
Also, Ice Castle maps can/>
optionally have this/>
cloud overlay.
