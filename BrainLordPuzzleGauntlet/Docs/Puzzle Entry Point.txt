Constructing a puzzle gauntlet definition file

This is the entrypoint file that should be loaded by the tool under "Puzzle File."

They can be named whatever you want, but I tend to name them with "_" so they show up first alphabetically
and I can find them easily.

See 
  Demonstration/_DemoPuzzles.txt 
  Sample/_SamplePuzzles.txt 
  VanillaPuzzles/_VanillaPuzzles.txt
for examples.

It's a simple text file with a list of properties.  Supported properties include:

start=(first map file.txt)|(e)
  Define the starting map and location.
  See Maps.txt and Tile Types.txt for details on how to set up the map files.
  (first map file.txt) = the map defintion file for the first map
  (e) = the Entry identifier the player will start at on that map
  "|" is used here as a separator to avoid conflicts with characters in filenames.
  The filename can be an absolute or relative path.  Recommend using relative paths
  and just keeping everything in the same directory.


startWithCape=(yes/no)
  Yes to start with the cape equipped instead of the bronze armor, for better movement speed.


startWithFireSword=(yes/no)
  Yes to start with the fire sword, so you can melt ice objects.


startingHealth=(n)
  Current and max health of the player for a new game.  Max you should use is 127.
  Default to 6 or whatever the vanilla game has if you don't specify it.


startingAtk=(n)
  Attack stat for the player.  Default to whatever the vanilla game defaults to (0, I think?)


startingDef=(n)
  Defense stat for the player.  Default to whatever the vanilla game defaults to (0, I think?)


practiceMode=(yes/no)
  Yes to replace locked puzzle doors with unlocked doors, for easier exploration/testing.


fasterPushing=(yes/no)
  Reduce the delay when pushing objects as a quality-of-life change.
  Default off.


key(n).name
key(n).desc
  Change the name or description of key number (n), as referenced by chests and doors in
  map files, so you can customize keys to your own puzzles.
