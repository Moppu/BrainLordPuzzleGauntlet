A list of the types of tiles that can be placed on maps.

These can be associated with a single character in the :datakey section of maps.

Note: see code under MapLoad/ for how these are actually implemented.

Supported tile types for placement on maps include:

-----------------------
----- Floor types -----
-----------------------


Empty
  the empty space outside maps


Floor
  regular floor.  shadows are added as appropriate for the tileset.


Unshadowed Floor
  same as floor, except shadow effects from surrounding walls are not added.
  for maps where you're using floor tiles that don't have shadowed versions, this
  is sometimes helpful for a consistent look.  vanilla's phantom floor room in
  the tower is an example, since they use those rubble floor tiles to indicate
  safe spots, but there is no shadowed version of them.


Hole
  a hole you can fall into.  edges are added as appropriate for the tileset.


Floor Crest
  a highlighted floor tile for drawing attention to things like entry positions or objects.


Icy Floor
  slippery floor for ice castle maps.
  unsupported on other map types and changed to Floor.


Cracked Floor
  floor that becomes a hole when stepped on.
  supported only on Platinum tileset.  replaced by Hole on other tilesets.


Conveyor Left, Conveyor Right, Conveyor Up, Conveyor Down
  conveyor belt that pushes you in a specified direction.
  unsupported on Tower tileset and changed to Floor.
  Ruins tileset has opposing directions on a single tile.


Phantom Floor
  Floor that periodically drops out and becomes a Hole.
  Requires "phantom floor" property to be enabled for the map.
  on Tower tileset, these look like a normal floor and can be hidden.
  on Ruins tileset, it's bright blue and unhidden.
  other tilesets do not support it and replace it with Hole.


Definitely Not Phantom Floor
  for Tower maps, this is the little rocks that can show you where
  solid ground is.
  on other tilesets, replaced by Floor.


Electric Floor
  Floor that damages you on Ruins tileset.
  unsupported on other tilesets and replaced by Floor.


Trap
  spike tile that pops up when you walk near it.
  looks slightly different from the normal tile.
  unsupported on Ruins tileset and replaced by Electric Floor.
  unsupported on Platinum tileset and replaced by Cracked Floor.


Alternating Trap (n)
  where (n) = 1 - 4
  traps that auto-trigger and un-trigger on a timer, where any with the same number
  are in sync.
  only works on Ice Castle maps when the "alternating traps" property is set.
  note that this is an alternate map setting that makes other animations like
  waterfalls not work.


Toggle Switch (d) (c)
  a switch as part of a set of switches used to open a Toggle Door when pressed in a
  specific order.
  (d) = a number matching the "(n)" specified on a Toggle Door in order to pair the 
        two together.
  (c) = a number indicating the combination number associated with the switch.
  the order to unlock the door is defined by the "combo" property of the map; ie; 
    combo=34251
  to indicate that the following switches should be pressed in order:
    Toggle Switch (d) 3
	Toggle Switch (d) 4
	Toggle Switch (d) 2
	Toggle Switch (d) 5
	Toggle Switch (d) 1


Weighted Switch (d)
  a switch that needs to be held down to open a Weighted Door tile.
  (d) = a number matching the "(n)" specified on a Weighted Door in order to pair the 
  two together.


Falling Object Switch (n)
  a switch that summons a Falling Ice or Falling Ball object.  those objects won't
  appear until the switch paired with them is pressed.
  (n) = a number that matches "(n)" of a Falling Ice or Falling Ball object to indicate
        the two should be paired together.


Light Switch
  a switch that turns that lights on when pressed.
  the game hardcodes the tile this turns into when pressed, so it doesn't work on
  tilesets other than Ruins, which is the only one that supports the lights
  going out to begin with.
  i tried it in the Platinum dark rooms.  it doesn't work, and you get stuck because
  it turns into some wall tile.


Floor Warper (n)
  a doorway that transitions to another map when stepped upon.
  (n) = an identifier for the door that is also used in the destination definition.


Up Stairs (n)
  an upward stairway warper leading to another map.
  if the tile below it is a "Floor" tile, then the corresponding stairway leading 
  up to the warper will be added.
  (n) = an identifier for the door that is also used in the destination definition.


Down Stairs (n)
  a downward stairway warper leading to another map.
  unlike the Up Stairs, this is only ever a single tile and nothing is added
  adjacent to it.  feel free to add Floor Crest to highlight its landing location.
  (n) = an identifier for the door that is also used in the destination definition.


----------------------
----- Wall types -----
----------------------

Wall
  a solid wall.  for some tilesets, this is automatically shaped to form corners and other
  shapes based on the tiles surrounding it.
  horizontal walls should always be at least two tiles high, otherwise the game gets
  confused about how to render/obscure rooms.


Unlocked Door (n)
  an unlocked door that you can walk through any time.
  (n) = an identifier for the door that is also used in the destination definition.
  if placed at the bottom of a room, it appears as a socket down into the wall instead of a door.
  See "Entry" for how to control where the door goes.


Locked Door (n)>(key num)
  a locked door requiring a specific key to open.
  (n) = an identifier for the door that is also used in the destination definition
  (key num) = a base-10 number indicating the ID of the key that will open this door.
  Key names and descriptions can be customized in the puzzle entry-point file.  
  See Puzzle Entry Point.txt for details.


Weighted Door (n)
  Door that is unlocked by pushing objects onto a number of Weighted Switch tiles.
  (n) = a number that is the same as (d) on the Weighted Switch definition to indicate
  the door and switch are paired together. this is the identifier for the door that is also
  used in the destination definition.
  the first four Weighted Switches defined for the door will control the door, and
  others will not affect it.
  See "Entry" for how to control where the door goes.


Toggle Door (n)
  Door that is unlocked by pressing Toggle Switch tiles in a certain sequence.
  (n) = a number that is the same as (d) on the Toggle Switch definition to indicate
  the door and switch are paired together. this is the identifier for the door that is also
  used in the destination definition.
  can be used for numerical puzzles, however it should be noted that a maximum of eight
  of these switches can be paired to a given door, so you can't include every digit
  for a numerical puzzle.
  switches that are not part of the combination are ignored and can be pressed at
  any time.  this is vanilla behavior that i don't currently have a workaround for.
  See "Entry" for how to control where the door goes.


Wall Decoration 1
  can be used to highlight a spot on a wall, or otherwise decorate walls.
  should only be used for "inner" walls; ie, the wall directly above a floor tile.


Pillar Left
  a wall with a pillar or other object highlighting its left side.  usually
  used for decoration around wall corners, or near doors.


Pillar Right
  a wall with a pillar or other object highlighting its right side.  usually
  used for decoration around wall corners, or near doors.


Message Box (n)
  a plaque on the wall with a message to read.
  (n) = a numeric identifier of the message, used to pair the tile to the message
  the message is defined as a property of the map "message(n)" in the "properties" section.
    notes about text:
	  - supported characters include 
	     A-Z 
		 a-z 
		 0-9 
		 ).?:;'"-,*!
		 use / for a new line
		 use \ for a pause for the player to hit a button w/ a new line (should be placed every 4 lines)
		 use > to continue text on a new line
		 use ~ to enable/disable alternate color font, commonly used to highlight item names, etc
      - 26 characters max on one line before you should put a / new line.
      - many examples available in the Demo files


------------------------
----- Object types -----
------------------------

  ************************************************************************************************** 
  Note: all types below can be preceded by [Floor type:] to optionally specify a floor type they will
  appear on top of.  If unspecified, a sensible default for the given object will be chosen.
  ie.
    e=Floor Crest:Save Point
	E=Save Point
  **************************************************************************************************


Save Point=(Save name)
  a save statue.
  the save name is the name it will show up under in warp gate menus.


Chest=(item name)
  a chest with the specified item, spell, or jade in it.  
  for the most part, you can use vanilla item names here.
  see Resources/Misc/ChestItems.txt for the list of items that can be specified here.  names are
  case-insensitive.  some examples that may be useful for puzzles are:
    - phaser
	   the spell that lets you freeze the platinum water temporarily
	- wind shoes
	   a debug accessory that lets you walk over holes
	- fire sword
	   sword that lets you melt ice blocks.  there's also an option to start with this equipped.
	- cape
	   armor that increases your movement speed to match the rolling balls.  there's also an option
	   to start with this equipped.
	- key (n)
	   consumable key to a specific locked door
  Note that keys are indicated by base-10 number here (Key 5, etc) and their names and descriptions
  can be customized in the puzzle entry-point file.  See Puzzle Entry Point.txt for details.


Pushable Rock (or just "Rock")
  a rock you can push onto Weighted Switch floors to solve puzzles.  moves one tile at a time.


Pushable Ball (or just "Ball")
  a ball you can push onto Weighted Switch floors to solve puzzles.  moves until it hits another
  solid object or wall.  note that some other floor types (like Platinum's Cracked Floor) will
  stop it also.


Pushable Bouncing Ball (or just "Bouncing Ball")
  a blue pushable ball that bounces backward when it hits a solid object or wall.


Red Ball
  a red ball that starts moving toward you if you're directly in a cardinal direction
  from it.  really laggy and should be used sparingly.


Pushable Tower Wall (or just "Tower Wall")
  the pushable wall used to hide secrets in a couple vanilla Tower maps.
  acts the same as a Rock.


Pushable Ruins Wall (or just "Ruins Wall")
  the pushable wall used to hide secrets in a couple vanilla Ruins maps.
  acts the same as a Rock.


Pushable Droog Statue (or just "Droog Statue")
  i'm not sure why this is pushable, but it seems to work the same as the rocks, so i threw
  it in in case anyone wants to use it.  it looks like the statue on the Toronto path that
  you put the sapphire into to unlock Droog.


Pushable Ice (or just "Ice")
  same as the Pushable Rock, except it looks like ice, and can be melted by the fire sword.


Pushable Sliding Ice (or just "Sliding Ice")
  same as the Pushable Ball, except it looks like ice, and can be melted by the fire sword.


Pushable Bouncing Ice (or just "Bouncing Ice")
  same as the Pushable Bouncing Ball, except it looks like ice, and can be melted by the fire sword.


Pushable Moving Ice (or just "Moving Ice")
  ice that moves a random direction every couple seconds.
  there are more values for this that cause it to move more specific directions, and i may
  include them later if they end up being interesting for puzzles.


Moving Platform (n)
  the gray platforms that move a specific distance/pattern and then back when you step or
  jump on them.


Automated Moving Platform (n)
  like Moving Platform, except they move back and forth periodically instead of when you
  step on them.


Controllable Platform (or just "Platform")
  the pushable, rideable platforms from Ruins that you can use to move over holes.


Falling Ice (n)
  a Sliding Ice that appears when a button is pushed.
  (n) = a numeric identifier matching the Falling Object Switch that drops it.


Falling Ball (n)
  a Pushable Ball that appears when a button is pushed.
  (n) = a numeric identifier matching the Falling Object Switch that drops it.


-----------------
----- Other -----
-----------------

Entry (n)[>direction]
  an entry point into the map, to be referenced from other maps when creating doors.
  (n) = a numeric identifier for the entry
  Every door on the map should have a corresponding destination definition in the "properties" section:
    door(n)dest=(filename),(e)
	(n) = the numeric identifier of the door, specified in Door type definitions above
	(filename) = the name of the map the door should transition to
	(e) = the id of the Entry on the target map where the door should put you
  the bracketed direction block is optional; if a direction is specified, ie:
    Entry 2>left
  then transitioning to this entry point will cause you to face that direction.
  if unspecified, you'll face up, or down if the door is above you.


@xx
  place tile xx (in hex) from the chosen tileset.
  note that while the named tiles are designed to work as well as possible in any tileset,
  using a specific tile value like this will make your map only look correct in the current tileset.
  Brain Lord's tile ids for a given tile type should NOT be expected to line up between tilesets; that
  is, a door tile may be 0x12 in one tileset, but 0x37 in another.
  This should really only be used to place tiles that I don't currently provide a named tile type for.

  the sample puzzle file under "Demonstration" provides maps that show tile ids for every tileset.
  go in the right door on the first map to find them.
