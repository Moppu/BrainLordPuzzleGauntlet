Constructing a map file

Note that for any line in any section below, start the line with "#" to
make the line a comment.

Maps are in a human-editable text format with three separate sections:

-----------------------
---- Map Properties ---
-----------------------

Section indicated by:
:properties

Defines map-wide properties, specified by:
key name=value  

Supported properties include:

tileset=(tileset)
  Define the tileset to be used for the map.  Supported values for (tileset) currently include:
  - Tower
  - Ruins
  - Ice Castle
  - Platinum
  More may be added later, but these are the main tilesets with a majority of the puzzle elements available.


music=(music)
  Define the music for the map.  See Music.txt for a list of supported values for (music).


door(n)dest=(destination.txt),(e)
  Define a destination for a door (n) to map (destination.txt) at entry point (e).
  See "Entry" in Tile Types.txt for how to define these and pair them to doors.


phantom floor=(yes/no)
  For maps where the tileset is Tower or Ruins, enable phantom floor.
  If this is disabled, phantom floor tiles will act as normal floors and never disappear.
  If this is enabled, they will disappear occasionally accompanied by that noise they make.


ice castle clouds=(yes/no)
  For maps using the Ice Castle tileset, show or hide the overlay fog on layer 2.
  Default off.


alternating traps=(yes/no)
  For maps using the Ice Castle tileset, whether the Alternating Trap tile types
  will work.
  See Alternating Trap (n) in Tile Types.txt.


dark=(yes/no)
  For maps in the Ruins tileset, make the room dark and lightable by Light Jade or a
  Light Switch.
  Note that for Ruins maps with holes, the holes appear red in darkness, and bright
  white after the lights come on with a switch.
  For maps using the Platinum tileset, make it one of those dark rooms that not
  even the light jade will light up.
  Should be used sparingly for Platinum, as these rooms are awful.


infinite respawns=(yes/no)
  Enemies will respawn in their original spot if killed and scrolled off the screen.
  Default off.


enemy spawn limit=(n)
  Enemies won't spawn if this many are already on the screen.
  Helps reduce lag in some situations.
  Default to no limit.


message(n)=...
  Define a message to be shown by a messagebox on a wall.
  See "Message Box" in Tile Types.txt for how to format the text.


-------------------
---- Data Key -----
-------------------

Section indicated by:
:datakey

Pairs a single text character with a tile type from Tile Types.txt to construct the map
in the following Map Data section.

Each tile type should be indicated by
(c)=(t)

where (c) is a single ASCII character (avoid using # and :) and (t) is a tile type from Tile Types.txt.


-------------------
---- Map Data -----
-------------------

Section indicated by:
:mapdata

Construct the map using the characters defined in the Data Key section.

Max width and height for Brain Lord maps are 64, but try to keep it under, say, 56 on each dimension,
otherwise the edges will look weird.
